Curved (Grading and Curving for Students and Educators)
#######################################################

1. Overview
============
Curve is a program that takes lists of grades, gives them weights and then
takes the weighted average to produce a final grade. You will also place a
grading curve if required. This tool can be used by students to calculate
their own grades.

2. Persona
=============

  1. **Name**: William Cole
  2. **Details**: As a student this tool will help me to see where I stand in any
   course, buy just entering my grades and there weights. I can see which classes
   require more work. I can then see how my GPA will be when I go further in SPS
  3. **Goals**: To simply see my grade and automatically.

3. Problem Scenario
======================

  While Excel can be used to calculate a students grades, I would like a simpler
  and more automatic course to get my grades.

1. **Current Alternatives**:Excel and Blackboard both can complete these tasks.
2. **Value Proposition**: This program can also be utilized to calculate
   further grades, and it would be an automatic process.

4. User Stories
==================
A student, John Doe, isn't sure of their GPA. This program will help them see
where they need to work harder in. It also allows a teacher to do the same.

5. Acceptance Stories
=====================
One of my friends, who is also in school, named Zak beta tested my code to
calculate his GPA. He gave me some ideas on how to make it easier to use for
some one who isn't a CS or IS major. For instance originally I would make the
user create tupples of each grading group:

::
  [William Cole],[90,79,80,85],[90,80,98],[95]

He said it was a little anoying so have to enter it this way, he asked me if
there was a way to use some other way to divide up the grades. He thought if
he had to type out for every group he would forget a parenthesis...
So I came in with a more attractive example. Using the "|" as a seperator.

::
  William Cole | 90, 80 ,70 | 90,80,98 | 95

While the brackets never bothered me, he thought this was more asthetically
pleasing, *he's an art major*, and thought it made for easier use. He has also
never used the terminal before so having a simple text based entry system,
instead of having to use a couple of command codes, made the experiance a whole
lot more accesable for the not so technical person.
