1. Overview
============
Curve is a program that takes lists of grades, gives them weights and then
takes the weighted average to produce a final grade. You will also place a
grading curve if required. This tool can be used by students to calculate
their own grades.

2. Persona
=============

1. **Name**: William Cole
2. **Details**: As a student this tool will help me to see where I stand in any
   course, buy just entering my grades and there weights. I can see which classes
   require more work. I can then see how my GPA will be when I go further in SPS
3. **Goals**: To simply see my grade and automatically.

3. Problem Scenario
====================

While Excel can be used to calculate a students grades, I would like a simpler
and more automatic course to get my grades.

1. **Current Alternatives**:Excel and Blackboard both can complete these tasks.

   further grades, and it would be an automatic process.
