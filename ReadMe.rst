The Curved Program is all incompasing. No extra modules are required for execution. 

2. Executing Curved.py
=======================
**Formatting input file:**

When you are planning on importing a list of students, or just one Student by using the following format:
::
    John Doe|85.0,92.0,88.0,92.0,95.0,94.0,91.0,90.0,93.0,92.0|86.0,89.0,89.0,85.0,84.0,91.0,93.0|89.0,86.0,85.0

The "|" seperators denote the transitions in grading weight. 
::
    Student|Homework|Quizes|Tests

**Default Weight System:**

Assignments = 20%
Quizes      = 30%
Exams       = 50%

::
    **Note:**
    It's simple to change the default weights as they are on the top of the Curved.py Program.
